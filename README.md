**AI4Good Team5 Project**

Building an AI tool to predict energy consumption of (households/industries/cities/provinces) for effective future planning purposes for the government and possibly recommending solutions specific to the user as per his location, budget, comfort, and other constraints to reduce his carbon footprint and cost at the same time.

**Data Acquisition**

The dataset acquired from a household in New York City which involves appliances level power consumption and weather data. 

**Data Preprocessing**

Handling missing values
Data normalization (scaling the values between [0,1])

**Predicting Model**

We implemented Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model using Pytorch API.
